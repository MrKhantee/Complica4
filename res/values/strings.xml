    <string name="about_text">Complica4 was implemented by Velbazhd Software LLC as a promotional game for Rolers Net website.</string>
    <string name="help_text">Complica4 is a modified version for four players of the game Complica, which is similar to the game Connect Four. In Complica (not like in Connect Four), when a piece is placed, it does not remain there for the entire game. Another piece may be used to slide the entire row over. Winner is first person to have 4 pieces in a row. The mechanic of the sliding rows means that each player can possibly have 4 in a row at the same time, causing the game to continue until this situation can be broken up.</string>
